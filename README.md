# Welcome to the Future of Fintech Spring 2023 challenge!

## **Theme:** ⚡ Electricity ⚡

For the past year and a half, electricity prices have been soaring and it affects us all. To help save on prices people are taking active measures like lowering the temperature and being more careful of turning of the lights.

Even though with active measures, the most effective way of saving money on power is by choosing a power provider that charges the least amount of money (😝).

So in this task, we want you to create an application or service that can help consumers choose which power provider that is cheapest for them. You can solve this task in any way you want to, either frontend, backend or with design. See the **How to deliver** section below for what is relevant for you.

## How to solve it

You probably want to base your solution on some data. See under the **Data** section on where you can get mock data.

You are free to base you solution from this web application. It is a Javascript and React application that contains a simple data fetcher and a library for displaying the data in graphs. If you use this repository as the base, please read the [How to run]() file on how to do so.

Otherwise are you free to start from scratch. As mentioned, the solution can have a frontend, be a service that is accessable through an API or a sketch for how the solution might look with an emphasis on the user experience.

You are free to be as creative as you want. The app can be what you want as long as it follows the theme in some way (and most preferably has something to do with Fintech). We love to see how you solve in many different ways! You can see an example of an similar app at [Strømpris.no](https://www.strompris.no/)

## Data

We have created two different datasets that you can either read/copy directly from the folder. One is for the power consumption the last 500 hours for one household, the second is the prices and price models of some made up power providers. They are located in the `data` folder in this repository

The data is also available through an API. So if you for example go to `https://www.PUT_IN_FINAL_URL/api/providers` you will get the same data.

Endpoints:

`https://www.PUT_IN_FINAL_URL/api/providers`, `https://www.PUT_IN_FINAL_URL/api/consumption`

## How to deliver

### Important!

> We advise you to be concious about how your work can be assessed. Make it simple to access, run, and review. 😊

> We can only review work that we can run, so make sure to package dependencies, include instructions, etc.

> If you are able to host your system in any form, please do! ([Vercel](https://vercel.com/), [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/home) and [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) are some great free hosting alternatives)

### Design/UX

1. Somewhere where your sketch is stored. This can be a link to a Figma-, XD-, or sketch document or a set of pictures.
2. Feel free to supplement with something that explains what you have designed, why you designed it like that and what you might have improved upon if you were to do it differently or had more time. 🕒 These can also be embedded directly into your design document if your design software supports it.
3. [ Send it to challenge@stacc.com 📬 ](mailto:challenge@stacc.com)

### Code

1. We prefer to have your work published as a **public git repository**.
2. If you do not want your work to be public then please contact us so that you can share it with your reviewers directly.
3. You need to include an _readme.md_ file that details some basic information about your project.  
   [The template can be found here](https://github.com/stacc/stacc-challenge-public/blob/main/readme.md.template)
4. We also strongly suggest that you make an assessment of how your application can be run on other systems.
